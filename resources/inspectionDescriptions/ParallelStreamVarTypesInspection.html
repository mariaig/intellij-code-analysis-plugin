Not all stream-sources are splittable as good as others. <br>
This inspection provides a configurable way of adding stream sources that perform badly
for parallel streams such as BlockingQueue or LinkedList. <br>
The list of sources that should trigger this inspection can be set in the text box from the inspection menu. <br>
If you want to use custom data structures, you should add them as full.package.reference.YourList.
