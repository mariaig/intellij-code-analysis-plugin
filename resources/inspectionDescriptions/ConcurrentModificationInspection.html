Conccurent Modification Exception may be thrown by methods that have detected concurrent modification of an object when such modification is not permissible. For example, it is not generally permissible for one thread to modify a Collection while another thread is iterating over it.
However, this case is treated only for non thread safe collections from java.util. Collections such as Vector & Hashtable or the ones from java.util.concurrent are not covered by this inspection.
