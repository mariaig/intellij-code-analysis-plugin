Detects a direct chain of  sorted(..).limit(..) and it provides a suggestion, without an associated quick fix. <br>
If you want to compute the top ’k’ elements of a collection with ’n’ elements, you would typically want to avoid sorting the whole collection, in O(nlogn) time. An easy to implement alternative is to build a min-heap, in linear time, from the original collection and extract the top ’k’ elements in O(n+klogn) time.
