Detects a direct chain of sorted(..).distinct().
If you want to compute a sorted subset of a collection, you should always get the subset first (distinct) and then sort it (sorted). In the worst case scenario, the subset will be the actual collection, so you will sort the full collection. But otherwise, you will sort just the elements that are you interested in.
