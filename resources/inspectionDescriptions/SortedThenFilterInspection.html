Take the following example:
You have a list of 100 unsorted numbers and you want to have at the end a sorted list of prime numbers. <br>
Let's assume that in the list are 20 even numbers. <br>
If you first sort the list and then filter it, you will sort 100 numbers and than search for the prime ones. <br>
But if you switch the order of sort and filter operations (filter first and then sort), in the end you'll sort only 20 numbers. <br>
